cocos2d-html5.ts
================

Typescript version of cocos/cocos2d-html5 repository. Only HelloHTML5World is implemented in TypeScript so far and only then the src/myApp.ts file.

The latest cocos2d-html5 doesn't seem to be working with IE11 and IE11 WebGL has issues so the file uses the CanvasRenderer instead. It works with Firefox and Chrome correctly though.

The licenses for this project is the same as the cocos2d-html5 licenses.
